# **Provider Opt-In/Opt-Out and MAS Updates Process**

## **1. Overview**

This process is performed when a provider requests to **opt out** or **opt into** a product or line of business in any or all brands under **Emblem Health**. Updates can be made **individually** or in **mass**.

* All requests are sent to the **PFO** via the following mailboxes:

  * [providermodifications@emblemhealth.com](mailto:providermodifications@emblemhealth.com)
  * [provideroperations@emblemhealth.com](mailto:provideroperations@emblemhealth.com)
  * [providerfileoperations@connecticare.com](mailto:providerfileoperations@connecticare.com)
  * [hmoppocpfhcsupdate@emblemhealth.com](mailto:hmoppocpfhcsupdate@emblemhealth.com)

* PFO follows specific processes based on the **email subject line**:

  * Subject should include: `opt out` or `opt in`, **provider name**, and **license number**.
  * If subject line contains **STAT** or **DOH**, escalate to **priority processing**.
  * Otherwise, process the **oldest request** in the queue.

### **Important Reminders**

* Do **not retroactively opt out** providers. Use the date of implementation or a future date.
* For **HIP and GHI HMO**, providers **cannot opt out** of commercial LOVs.
* For **GHI PPO**, providers **cannot opt out** of CBP. Doing so is considered a termination.
